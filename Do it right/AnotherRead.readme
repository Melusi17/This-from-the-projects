Exactly! You're 100% right bro.

**Just like prescriptions:**
- Customer uploads → No doctor assigned yet
- Pharmacist processes → Assigns doctor

**Same for orders:**
- Customer places order → No pharmacist assigned yet  
- Pharmacist processes → System records their ID

So yes, the `PharmacistID` on the Order model should definitely be **nullable**. It starts as null when the customer places the order, and gets populated when a pharmacist actually processes it.

This maintains the exact same pattern:
- **Initial state**: Customer action, no staff assigned
- **Processing state**: Staff member takes ownership and gets recorded

It's consistent with your existing prescription workflow and makes perfect sense from a business process perspective. The pharmacist only gets associated when they actually work on the order, not when it's created.
